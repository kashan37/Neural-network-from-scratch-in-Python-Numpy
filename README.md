# Neural Networks from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements neural networks **from scratch** using only Python and NumPy, without deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
The models are trained to classify images as **cat** or **non-cat**â€” includes a 2-layer and an L-layer model trained to classify cat vs non-cat images.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- 2-layer neural network implementation
- L-layer (deep) neural network implementation
- Forward and backward propagation from scratch
- Uses sigmoid, ReLU activations
- Gradient descent optimization
- Trained on "cat vs non-cat" dataset
ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset files are included in this repository:

train_catvnoncat.h5

test_catvnoncat.h5

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
